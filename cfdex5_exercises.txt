5th SET OF EXERCISES
(Numerical solution of parabolic partial differential equations with finite differences)


Exercise 5.1
----------------
Consider the unknown temperature T = T(t, x) of a one-dimensional heat diffusion problem in a duct of length L = 1 m, governed by the following equation:

∂T/∂t = ∂²T/∂x²

where the independent variables t and x denote time and the longitudinal distance measured from the upstream end of the duct, respectively. The domain of the equation is the set D = {0 ≤ t ≤ T_final, 0 ≤ x ≤ L} with T_final = 2 s.

Furthermore, the initial condition (Dirichlet type) for the temperature at time t = 0 is given:

T(t = 0, x) = 10,    0 ≤ x ≤ L

and the boundary conditions (Dirichlet type) at the upstream (x = 0) and downstream (x = L) ends of the duct are:

T(t, x = 0) = 0,    0 < t ≤ T_final
and
T(t, x = L) = 0,    0 < t ≤ T_final, respectively.


Requested:
----------------
Implement in the Matlab programming language the solution of the above equation to determine the spatial distribution of temperature for each time step using:

1. The Explicit numerical scheme.
2. The Simple Implicit scheme.
3. The Crank-Nicolson implicit scheme.

For each scheme, the results should be presented in the form of suitable plots and, indicatively, some results in numerical form.

Note: For the explicit scheme, a stability check must be performed.


Deadline:
----------------
Until the day of the final written examination.
