2nd SET OF EXERCISES
(Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations - initial value problems)


Exercise 2.1
----------------
Implement in the Matlab programming language the solution of the initial value problem:
y' = 1 + (t - y)^2,  y(2) = 1,  2 ≤ t ≤ 3,

using the following methods:
1. Explicit Euler method.
2. Implicit Euler method.
3. Runge-Kutta 2nd order.
4. Runge-Kutta 3rd order.
5. Runge-Kutta 4th order.

Given that the analytical solution of the above problem is:
y(t) = t + 1 / (1 - t)

Perform a comparison between the analytical and numerical solutions by calculating the error for all methods.

The results, apart from their numerical form, must also be presented in the form of diagrams.
